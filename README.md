# Machine Learning Project : Generation of lead sheets and inference in jazz

This project aims to generate lead sheets of jazz music, represented as coherent chord label sequences with the help of probabilistic models. The motivation for this approach comes from a recent article on text-based LSTM networks for automatic music composition (Choi, 2015). In this paper, the authors use a recurrent neural network (RNN-LSTM) to generate symbolic chord sequences. They focus on two different approaches named word-RNN and char-RNN. These two variants use the same model architecture but rely on different learning methods. In this project, we will improve the word-RNN approach by injecting music theory knowledge through the learning method in order to be able to perform accurate prediction of chord sequence and jazz melody generation. 
Ultimately, this project could be used to perform automatic accompaniment and improvisation.
